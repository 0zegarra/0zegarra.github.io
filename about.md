Welcome to my blog!
I am a cyber security engineer at The Mitre Corporation in Bedford MA.  Having come out of college I am still very new to the world of cyber security and professional life in general. 

I created this blog for two simple reasons.  First, I want to write about the topics that I am passionate about in a simple, clear and consise way.  This can range from topics in cyber security to nation security.  Secondly, I hope that my blog posts introduction to the field of cyber security.  I am very new to the field so this will be an exciting adventure!
